# üß† Obsidian Duplicate Finder

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

**Obsidian Duplicate Finder** is a standalone desktop application designed to help users identify and remove duplicate or near-duplicate Markdown (`.md`) files in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. The tool provides a visual interface for:

- Scanning all Markdown files in a selected folder (vault)
- Calculating textual similarity using TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- Grouping similar documents
- Previewing and selectively deleting redundant files

### Problem Statement

Users working extensively in Obsidian or any Markdown-based note-taking system often accumulate redundant notes due to copy-pasting, repeated imports, or overlapping ideas. Manually identifying such duplicates is tedious and error-prone.

### Value Proposition

This application automates the process of duplicate detection, saving time and decluttering knowledge bases. It offers:

- Adjustable similarity threshold
- Real-time file preview
- Batch or individual file deletion with confirmation
- Progress tracking for large vaults
